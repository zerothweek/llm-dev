  You will be given a list of context. Your task is to extract the most relevant context for the user's query.

  Here is the context:
  {contexts}

  Your task is to extract the most relevant context for the user's query.
  Each context is delimited by `[index]`.

  Remember:
  - Your response should be only the relevant context for the user's query, nothing else.
  - Only return the index of the relevant context.

  Your output should be indexes(just numbers) of the relevant context, separated by comma.
  index1,index2,index3,...
