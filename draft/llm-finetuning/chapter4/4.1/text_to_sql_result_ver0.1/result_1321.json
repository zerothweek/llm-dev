"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query retrieves post data from the Posts table based on certain conditions related to the closed date and tags, specifically focusing on posts that are closed within the year 2019 and are tagged with '<spring-boot>'. The second query calculates rankings based on user votes related to posts, aggregates the votes by user, and returns the ranking of users based on their reputation derived from the votes. The first query deals with posts, while the second deals with user reputations, making their semantic meanings fundamentally different.\"\n}"
