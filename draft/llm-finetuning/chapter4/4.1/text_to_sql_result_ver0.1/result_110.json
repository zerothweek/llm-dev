"{\n    \"answer\": \"1\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Both SQL queries are identical and return the same results. They both select the bedType and the average basePrice from the Rooms table, grouping by bedType and ordering the results by bedType. This conforms to the task's requirement to list the average base prices by bed type, although the ordering by 'bedType' does not fulfill the requirement to order by price. However, since both queries do exactly the same, they are semantically equivalent.\"\n}"
