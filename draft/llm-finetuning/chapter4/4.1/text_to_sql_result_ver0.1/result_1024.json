"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical because they order the results by different columns. The first query orders by 'season' in descending order, which may retrieve the most recent season. The second query orders by 'id' in descending order, which does not necessarily correspond to the most recent season unless the 'id' is correlated with the sequence of seasons. Therefore, the results may differ based on the data in the table.\"\n}"
