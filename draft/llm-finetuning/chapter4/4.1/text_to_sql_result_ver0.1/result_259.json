"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical. The generated query filters posts that do not have an accepted answer, are of type 1, have a score of 0, and have specific tag requirements, among other conditions. It focuses on posts with the absence of interactions (answers and comments) and specific closed reasons. On the other hand, the correct query specifically looks for posts of type 2 with a score less than 1 and certain phrases in the body text. The conditions, target posts, and the types of information being searched for differ significantly between the two queries.\"\n}"
