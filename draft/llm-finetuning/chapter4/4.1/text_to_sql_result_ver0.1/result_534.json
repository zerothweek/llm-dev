"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries do not return semantically identical results. The generated query counts all edited posts by any user (i.e., any post with a non-null LastEditorUserId), while the answer query counts the distinct edited posts by a specific user (identified by '##UserId##') where several additional conditions are applied, including checking that the PostTypeId is equal to 1, ensuring that the post was not owned by that user, and verifying that the post's ClosedDate and CommunityOwnedDate are both null. This specificity makes the results of the two queries distinct.\"\n}"
