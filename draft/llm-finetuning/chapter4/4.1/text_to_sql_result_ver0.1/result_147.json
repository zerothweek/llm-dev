"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves posts with a specific type (PostTypeId = 1) and filters based on tags related to review task status. It does not count the number of reviews nor does it focus on 'ReviewTasks'. On the other hand, the second query joins 'ReviewTasks' and 'Posts', groups by 'PostId', counts reviews related to a specific 'ReviewTaskType' (type 6), and provides aggregate data (i.e., the number of reviews per post). Therefore, the queries have different focuses and do not yield semantically equivalent results.\"\n}"
