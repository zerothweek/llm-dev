"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query returns posts of type 1 that have been voted by a specific user with a specific vote type (8), while the second query selects posts that contain a specific tag and have a bounty amount greater than 0. The conditions for selecting posts do not overlap, as the first query focuses on user-specific votes and post types, whereas the second query focuses on tags and bounty amount. Therefore, the results returned by these queries can differ significantly.\"\n}"
