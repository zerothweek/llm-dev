"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first SQL query retrieves the RDW values for patients of the same age as patient 84346 without considering the discharge time (dischtime). The second SQL query includes a condition to ensure that only admissions that have a non-null discharge time are considered, effectively limiting the dataset to only completed admissions for patient 84346. This important difference can lead to the two queries returning different results, thus they are not semantically identical.\"\n}"
