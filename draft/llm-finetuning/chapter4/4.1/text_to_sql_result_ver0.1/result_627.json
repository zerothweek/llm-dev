"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The generated query looks for rows in the table where the 'Winning score' is exactly '274', while the correct query looks for a specific formatted string '72-67-68-67=274'. These two conditions are not the same; the first query checks for a plain value, while the second involves a specific string format that includes the score breakdown. Therefore, they do not return the same results.\"\n}"
