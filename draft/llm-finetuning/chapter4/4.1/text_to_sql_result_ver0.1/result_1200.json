"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically equivalent due to differences in the values used in the WHERE clause. The first query filters by outcome = 'runner-up' (with a hyphen) and opponent = 'ruxianga', while the second query filters by outcome = 'runner up' (without a hyphen) and opponent = 'lu jiaxiang'. These discrepancies in both the outcome text format and the opponent name will likely lead to different results.\"\n}"
