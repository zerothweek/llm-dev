"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query counts the total number of posts with type ID 2 grouped by month, without any conditions about accepted answers or the date limit (@until). The second query specifically calculates the percentage of accepted answers (post type ID 1) relative to total questions (post type ID 1) created before a given date (@until) that have an accepted answer (linked by ParentId to post type ID 2). Therefore, the two queries are not semantically equivalent, as they measure different metrics and are filtered by different conditions.\"\n}"
