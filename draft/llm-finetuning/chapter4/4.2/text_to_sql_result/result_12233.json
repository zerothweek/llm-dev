"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query filters patients based on their year of birth (dob_year) being less than 2148, while the second query filters patients based on their admission year (admityear) being less than 2148. Since the conditions relate to different attributes (dob_year vs. admityear), they do not semantically yield the same result. The first query counts patients who were born before 2148, whereas the second query counts patients admitted before 2148, which could include individuals born after that year.\"\n}"
