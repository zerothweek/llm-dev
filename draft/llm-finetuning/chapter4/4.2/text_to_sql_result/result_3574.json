"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries differ in several key aspects. The first query selects users with a reputation greater than 10,000 and limits results to users who have accessed within the past year, while the second query does not have these additional filters and includes a calculation of reputation per question. Furthermore, the first query counts questions specifically while the second counts posts of type 1 and includes only those that are not closed or deleted. As a result, their filtering criteria and the way they aggregate data lead to differing outputs, particularly in regards to active users, time constraints, and deleted/closed posts.\"\n}"
