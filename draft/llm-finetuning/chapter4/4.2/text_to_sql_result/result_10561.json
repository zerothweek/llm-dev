"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query selects posts where the owner is different from the user specified ('##UserId:int##') that corresponds to the parent post. It implies a direct relationship with the posts' owners who answered a specific question. The second query, on the other hand, retrieves users who commented on posts owned by the specified user (206691), while ensuring that the commenting user is not the same as the user in question. Moreover, the second query selects additional information about the users and their comments, which the first query does not capture. Thus, the focus and criteria of the queries differ, resulting in different outputs.\"\n}"
