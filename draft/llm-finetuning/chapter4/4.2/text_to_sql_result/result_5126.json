"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves all review rejection reasons from the 'ReviewRejectionReasons' table based on a specific 'PostTypeId'. In contrast, the second query retrieves 'ReviewTaskId' values based on 'RejectionReasonId' filtered by two specific rejection reasons (1 and 104) and involves a join between 'ReviewTaskResults' and 'ReviewTasks'. These queries do not yield the same results as the first query lists rejection reasons while the second targets specific review tasks related to only certain reasons.\"\n}"
