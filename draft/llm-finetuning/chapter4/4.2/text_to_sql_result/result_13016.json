"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries check for different treatment names: the first query looks for 'tpn', while the second query searches for 'parenteral feeds - tpn'.

Therefore, the queries may return different results based on the valid entries in the treatment table.\"\n}"
