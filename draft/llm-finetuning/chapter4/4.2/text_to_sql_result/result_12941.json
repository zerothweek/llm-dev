"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries produce different outputs. The first query attempts to retrieve the length of only the most recent post for each user with a reputation above 10,000, while the second query calculates the average length of all posts for each qualified user. Therefore, the first query can return a length for users with very few posts, while the second query groups all their posts to compute an average, leading to potentially different sets of users and different result sets.\"\n}"
