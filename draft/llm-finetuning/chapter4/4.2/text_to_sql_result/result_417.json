"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query selects users whose location includes 'razco' and limits the results to the top 50 users based on reputation. The second query, however, selects users whose location includes 'pune' (case insensitive) or exactly matches 'PUNE', with a limit of 500 users. The locations being searched are different ('razco' vs 'pune'), leading to different sets of users being returned by each query. Therefore, the two queries do not return semantically identical results.\"\n}"
