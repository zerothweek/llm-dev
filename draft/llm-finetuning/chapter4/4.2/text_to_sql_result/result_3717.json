"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically equivalent because they filter on different columns. The generated query filters on the 'Part number(s)' column, while the correct query filters on the 'sSpec number' column. Since the problem specifically asks for the release date based on the 'sSpec number', the use of 'Part number(s)' in the generated query will likely yield a different result.\"\n}"
