"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical because they filter the results based on different criteria. The 생성된 쿼리 includes conditions for both Title and Body with the use of the LOWER function for case-insensitivity, while also applying an OR condition within the Tags filter. In contrast, the 정답 쿼리 does not apply any case-insensitivity nor does it consider alternative matching for Title and Body, and it uses exact LIKE conditions instead of the LOWER function. As a result, the two queries can produce different sets of results.\"\n}"
