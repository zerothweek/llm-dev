"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query calculates the average scores of questions and answers across all users without considering ownership, returning a single average for each type. The second query computes the average scores of questions and answers for each owner (user), grouping by user and factoring in their upvotes and downvotes, which leads to a different aggregation context. Consequently, while both queries deal with average scores, they operate on distinct datasets and metrics, thus yielding different results.\"\n}"
