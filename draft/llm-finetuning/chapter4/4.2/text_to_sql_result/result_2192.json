"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries differ significantly in their output and the specific conditions applied. The first query counts total posts and determines open and closed questions based on the ClosedDate, summing up the bounty amounts, but does not specify that only questions without accepted answers are included. It returns basic statistics about all owner user IDs with total bounties and counts of questions regardless of their status (accepted or closed). In contrast, the second query specifically filters for open questions only (AcceptedAnswerId IS NULL) and returns additional user information such as DisplayName and Reputation, along with counting bounties that are specifically identified by VoteTypeId = 8. Therefore, their focus and outputs are distinctly different, making them semantically non-equivalent.\"\n}"
