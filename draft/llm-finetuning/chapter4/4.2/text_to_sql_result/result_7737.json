"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query calculates the average altitude of mountains with a rank less than 10 within the 'mühlig-hofmann mountains' parent range. The second query counts the number of mountains with a rank less than 10 that fall within the 'mühlig-hofmann mountains' range. Hence, the first query focuses on average altitude while the second focuses on the count of mountains; they are fundamentally different in terms of the aggregation performed (average vs count) and the specific condition used (Parent Range vs Range).\"\n}"
