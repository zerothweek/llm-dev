"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves posts that contain both '<html>' and '<css>' tags in any order and allows for additional tags, as indicated by the use of 'LIKE'. In contrast, the second query requires posts to have exactly the '<css><html>' tags with no additional tags allowed, as indicated by the use of equality ('Tags = '<css><html>'). Since the first query is more flexible and allows posts with other tags, while the second query is strict about the tag format, they do not return semantically identical results.\"\n}"
