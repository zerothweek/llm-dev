"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves posts with a Tags field that contains the substring 'api' anywhere in it, while the second query only retrieves posts where the Tags field is exactly equal to '<api>'. This means the first query could return posts with multiple tags that include 'api', whereas the second query only returns posts tagged specifically with '<api>'. Therefore, they do not return the same set of results semantically.\"\n}"
