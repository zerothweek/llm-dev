"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query selects posts directly from the Posts table based on specific conditions (PostTypeId = 1, ClosedDate is NULL, Score <= 0, etc.) and sorts them by CreationDate. The second query joins PostLinks and Posts, retrieving related post links where the related post is not closed, and it sorts the results differently (by PostId in descending order) and limits the results to 100. Thus, they are querying different conditions and tables and will likely return different results.\"\n}"
