"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically identical. The first query retrieves the 'departure_time' for flights from Atlanta to San Francisco that leave at 12:00 PM on November 7, 1991, while the second query retrieves the 'time_elapsed' for the same flights. These are two different pieces of information: one is when the flight departs, and the other is how long the flight takes. Thus, they do not return the same result related to the flight duration.\"\n}"
