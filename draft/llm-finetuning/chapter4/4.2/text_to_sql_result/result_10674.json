"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical. The first query filters 'Posts' where 'PostTypeId' is 1, checks if the 'Body' contains 'http', and ensures the length of the 'Body' is less than or equal to '##bodylen##'. It retrieves the 'Id' and 'CreationDate' columns, limiting the output to the latest 100 entries. The second query retrieves all columns from 'Posts' where 'PostTypeId' is 2 and the length of 'Body' is less than or equal to '##bodylen##'. The different conditions on 'PostTypeId' and the presence of the 'http' check in the first query indicate that the results of the two queries will differ significantly.\"\n}"
