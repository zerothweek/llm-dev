"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query calculates the total number of questions, the number of accepted answers, and the accepted answer percentage for open questions that are not community-owned. It returns a single aggregated result without grouping. The second query, on the other hand, groups the results by year of creation and calculates the total number of accepted and not accepted answers, along with the acceptance rate specifically for questions that have at least one answer. The grouping and the conditions applied in the second query make it fundamentally different in terms of the results it generates compared to the first query.\"\n}"
