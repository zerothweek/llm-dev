"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Two SQL queries differ in their conditions: the first query looks for losses labeled as 'loss' with interim head coach 'dwayne wadewicz', while the second looks for losses labeled as 'lost' with interim head coach 'dewayne walker'. The different values for 'result' and 'interim_head_coach' indicate that they could refer to different teams, thus they do not return the same results based on the problem statement.\"\n}"
