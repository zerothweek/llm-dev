"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries serve different purposes and filter based on different conditions. The first query selects posts of a specific type (PostTypeId = 2) with a body containing a specific URL format related to images from 'i.stack.imgur.com', and it retrieves the post ID and creation date. The second query, however, generates a URL for posts linked to a specific owner (OwnerUserId = ##UserId##) and requires the body to contain 'i.stack.imgur.com'. It also sorts by view count instead of creation date and returns a formatted URL instead of post ID and date. Thus, they do not return semantically identical results.\"  \n}"
