"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves distinct post links for posts with the tag 'nodejs' created within the year 2013, focusing specifically on posts of type 'Question'. The second query counts questions across multiple tags ('php', 'javascript', 'nodejs') created between July 1, 2014, and the current date, grouped by month and year. These queries differ significantly in the conditions applied, the range of dates considered, and the output format (links vs. counts per month). Therefore, they do not return semantically identical results.\"\n}"
