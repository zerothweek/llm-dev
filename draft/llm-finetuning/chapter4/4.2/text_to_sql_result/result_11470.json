"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical because they focus on different keyphrases: the first query searches for papers related to 'probabilistic optimization', while the second query looks for papers related to 'stochastic optimization'. Additionally, the first query returns the paper ID of the most cited paper, whereas the second query counts and groups citations of multiple papers. Thus, the results and underlying criteria for selection differ.\"\n}"
