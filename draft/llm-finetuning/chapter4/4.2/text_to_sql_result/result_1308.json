"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The generated query calculates the total view count, total question count, and average view count per question for posts of a specific type (PostTypeId = 1), grouped by OwnerUserId, while the answer query calculates the view count totals based on the reputation of the users and groups them accordingly.

Therefore, they do not return the same results.\"\n}"
