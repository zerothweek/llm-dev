"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query selects specific columns (card_id, customer_id, card_type_code, card_number) from the Customers_Cards table and orders the results by the card_number column. In contrast, the second query summarizes card_number by card_type_code using the SUM function, which changes the nature of the data being returned, grouping the records. Additionally, it does not include card_id or customer_id in the results, which are specifically requested in the problem statement. Therefore, the two queries do not return semantically equivalent results.\"\n}"
