"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first SQL query retrieves labels of items associated with output events for a specific subject, while the second SQL query retrieves long titles of diagnoses and procedures that match a specific short title.

Therefore, they do not semantically return the same result.\"\n}"
