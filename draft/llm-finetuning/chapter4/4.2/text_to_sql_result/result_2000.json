"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query counts votes by VoteTypeId for posts of a specific type (PostTypeId = 2), while the second query groups posts by Score and calculates the logarithm of the count of scores for the same post type. The first query focuses on vote distribution, whereas the second one focuses on scoring distribution, meaning they aggregate different types of data.\"\n}"
