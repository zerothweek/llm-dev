"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The generated query counts the documents based on the Date_in_Location_From from the Document_Locations table, while the correct query counts the documents based on the Date_Stored from the All_Documents table, joining it with the Ref_Calendar. As a result, they operate on different datasets (Document_Locations vs. All_Documents) and different date attributes, which leads to fundamentally different results. Therefore, they are not semantically the same.\"\n}"
