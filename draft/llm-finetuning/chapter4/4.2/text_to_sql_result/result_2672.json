"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves posts that contain the letter 'o' or 'ou' in the title or body, while the second query is focused on comparing the frequencies of tags that have similar names through a replacement of 'ou' with 'o'. These two queries are fundamentally different in their objectives and outputs. The first one targets post content, while the second one analyzes tagging, thus they do not return the same semantic results.\"\n}"
