"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query retrieves the maximum value of 'Polish Cup' specifically for a player named 'pułkać ługi' where 'Puchat Ligi' is greater than 0. The second query calculates the average value of 'Polish Cup' from all players where 'Puchat Ligi' is greater than 0. Therefore, they are querying different aggregates (maximum vs average) and different subsets of data (specific player vs all players), leading to different results.\"\n}"
