"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query checks for flights from Pittsburgh to Atlanta on a specific date (April 23, 1991) without any airline restriction. The second query, however, adds a condition that the airline code must be 'US'. This means that the second query is only looking for flights on that date operated by the US airline, while the first query does not have any such restriction. Therefore, the results will differ due to the airline filter present in the second query.\"\n}"
