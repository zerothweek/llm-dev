"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are semantically different. The generated query retrieves PostId, CreationDate, DeletionDate, OwnerUserId, Comment, and Text from the PostHistory table filtered by specific PostHistoryTypeIds and a condition on the Comment text, ordering by CreationDate. On the other hand, the correct query computes the Log2 reputation of users linked to review tasks and calculates the percentage distribution of those reputations. The focus of the generated query is on individual post history entries, while the correct query focuses on grouping and aggregating reputation data across users associated with review tasks.\"\n}"
