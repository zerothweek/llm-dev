"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query uses 'south melbourne' without quotes around the string, which makes it likely that it will not execute correctly in SQL since it treats it as a column or variable rather than a string literal. The second query correctly uses quotes, ensuring it is interpreted as the string 'south melbourne'. Thus, they will not return the same result due to this syntactical error.\"\n}"
