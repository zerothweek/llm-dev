"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query filters flights based on the day of the week (Monday) in relation to Pittsburgh and San Francisco. The second query specifically uses a given date (February 21, 1991) for both cities. While both queries are looking for first-class flights from San Francisco to Pittsburgh, the first query does not specify a concrete date while the second query explicitly identifies a specific date. Therefore, they are not semantically identical as one is date-sensitive and the other is day-sensitive only.\"\n}"
