"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Two queries have completely different purposes. The first query calculates summary statistics (total count, total score, average score, max score, and min score) for posts of a specific type that are currently open, while the second query computes how many suggested edits a user has left based on their history. The criteria and results context differ significantly, hence they do not produce semantically equivalent outcomes.\"\n}"
