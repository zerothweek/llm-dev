"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query retrieves comments made by a specific user, sorting them by score, but does not include any information about the associated posts. The second query retrieves information from both the Posts and Comments tables. It not only gets the comments by the user, but also retrieves details from the Posts table, such as the post's ID, score, and body, and includes an additional filtering condition based on a minimum score for comments. Furthermore, the column names and the indices of the ORDER BY clause differ between the two queries. Therefore, they do not produce the same result.\"\n}"
