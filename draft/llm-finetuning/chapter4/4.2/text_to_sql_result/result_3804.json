"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries do not return semantically identical results. The first query selects distinct user IDs from the Posts table where PostTypeId is 1 and Score is at least 3, which likely signifies a query related to posts of a particular type that have a minimum score (i.e., popular or highly-rated posts). The second query, however, focuses on joining multiple tables (PostHistory, PostLinks, and Posts) to identify users who have created specific types of post history (PostHistoryTypeId = 10) that mention 'GoldTagBadge' and have a specific relationship in the context of links between posts. The context and conditions of each query are different, suggesting they aim to retrieve different sets of users based on different criteria related to interactions with posts.\"\n}"
