"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query selects the top 100 posts by ViewCount, specifically for PostTypeId = 1, without any conditions on Score. The second query retrieves posts for the same PostTypeId but applies additional conditions on Score (between '##S1##' and '##S2##') and ViewCount (less than '##V2##'), and it also modifies ViewCount by dividing it by '##dV##'. Therefore, their results are not semantically identical due to the differing conditions and calculations applied in the second query.\"\n}"
