"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries return different results based on their conditions. The first query selects posts based on the presence of the 'java' tag while excluding specific 'java-ee' tags and orders them by creation date. The second query counts posts with a specific post type (PostTypeId = 1) and requires multiple specified tags (e.g., 'java', '.net', 'node.js', etc.) and groups the results by date. Therefore, they do not return semantically identical results.\"\n}"
