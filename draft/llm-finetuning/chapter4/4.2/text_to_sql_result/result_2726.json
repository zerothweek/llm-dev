"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically the same. The first query counts total questions and closed questions based on PostTypeId and filters on CreationDate to a specific year, while the second query aggregates counts of questions and answers by month and year, specifically for PostTypeId values of 1 and 2. The grouping and aggregation in the second query do not have a direct correspondence to the individual counts in the first query, and it does not account for closed questions, nor does it include all PostTypes like the first query does.\"\n}"
