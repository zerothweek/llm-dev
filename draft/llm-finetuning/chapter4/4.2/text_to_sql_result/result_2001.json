"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically identical because they are filtering based on different criteria. The first query counts patients who received a specific drug 'Radiation Therapy' from the prescriptions table, while the second query counts patients who had a procedure with the title 'Radiotherapeut proc NEC' from the procedures table. These are two distinctly different treatments and do not necessarily correlate directly, so the result sets will differ.\"\n}"
