"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query orders the teams by the number of silver medals they have won and returns the team with the highest silver count that is not Rosenborg. The second query, on the other hand, groups the results by teams and orders them by the total count of victories (regardless of silver or bronze) while excluding Rosenborg. These two approaches do not yield the same result because the first query does not account for total victories but focuses only on silver counts.\"\n}"
