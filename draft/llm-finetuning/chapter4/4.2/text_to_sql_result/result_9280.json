"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query selects posts of type 2 authored by a specific user and containing the 'python' tag, while the second query filters posts based on different conditions: it excludes certain post IDs, ensures there are no associated tags with a specific ID (indicating a tag that may be related to 'python'), and checks for a minimum score. This means that the conditions and criteria for selecting posts in both queries are different, leading to non-equivalent results.\"\n}"
