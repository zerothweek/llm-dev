"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves the maximum value of the 'Overall' cost for the player named 'Eric Cal Son', while the second query retrieves the minimum value of the 'Overall' cost from the entire table. These two queries are fundamentally different in what they are asking for: one is specific to a single player (Eric Cal Son) and looks for the maximum cost, while the other is a general query for all players looking for the minimum cost. Therefore, they do not return the same result.\"\n}"
