"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query selects suggested edits that belong to a specific owner user and have both a non-null approval date and a non-null rejection date, while limiting the results to 100 entries ordered by rejection date in descending order. The second query retrieves suggested edits that are associated with review tasks having a specific rejection reason ID (108), regardless of the owner user ID, and orders the results by creation date. Therefore, the criteria used in both queries are different, leading to different result sets.\"\n}"
