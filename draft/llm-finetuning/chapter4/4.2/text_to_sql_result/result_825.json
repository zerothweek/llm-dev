"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query filters users who have earned exactly three badges of specific criteria (Name = 'css', Class = 1, TagBased = 0) and retrieves their details. The second query, however, selects all entries from the 'Badges' table without any filtering or conditions. Therefore, they do not return semantically identical results; the first query targets specific users with specific badge criteria, while the second query retrieves all badges regardless of any conditions.\"\n}"
