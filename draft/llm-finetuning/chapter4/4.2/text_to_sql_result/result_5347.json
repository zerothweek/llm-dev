"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query counts users with a reputation of 15 or higher who are 12 years old or younger (i.e., aged 12 or less). The second query counts users who are younger than 10 years old. Since the age criteria and reputation criteria are different in both queries, they do not return the same results semantically. Therefore, they are not equivalent.\"\n}"
