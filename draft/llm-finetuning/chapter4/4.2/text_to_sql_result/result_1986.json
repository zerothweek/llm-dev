"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The 생성된 쿼리 retrieves posts directly from the Posts table where the user is the owner and the post type is '2', ordering the results by view count. In contrast, the 정답 쿼리 retrieves posts from the Posts table representing answers, and then it joins with another Posts table to get the corresponding question posts based on the parent-child relationship. This means the first query gives the user's own posts of type '2', while the second query gives the questions related to those answers, which does not directly match the intent of finding the most viewed questions the user answered.\"\n}"
