"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically equivalent. The generated query retrieves posts based on their history, specifically filtering for a certain post history type (TypeId = 4) and a specific user (UserId = '##UserId##'). In contrast, the answer query retrieves posts based on suggested edits and filters posts where the owner user ID matches a given value ('@UserId'). Thus, the filtered data and the conditions used in the WHERE clause are entirely different, relating to different aspects of post interaction.\"\n}"
