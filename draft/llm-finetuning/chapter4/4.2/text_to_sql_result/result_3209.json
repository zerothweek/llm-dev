"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The generated query COUNTs the number of titles for the winner associated with the New York Cosmos, which will return a single numeric count value. The correct query, however, retrieves the actual number of titles as a text value. These queries are not semantically equivalent because one returns a count (potentially 0) while the other returns the actual title count (as text) without aggregation.\"\n}"
