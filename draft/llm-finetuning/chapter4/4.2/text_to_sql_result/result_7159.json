"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries have different conditions and target different outcomes. The first query is looking for posts (specifically questions) of type 1 that have at least one answer and at least one comment, are not closed, and do not have any comments that mention 'cross'. The second query seeks comments that contain a specific URL and are linked to posts that have zero answers and are still open. Therefore, they do not semantically retrieve the same set of data based on their criteria.\"\n}"
