"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query selects posts of type 2 that contain the phrase 'Thank you for your help*' in the body, whereas the second query selects comments that contain 'Fixed, thank' and restricts results to those with a length of less than 20 characters. The criteria for selection, the tables being queried (Posts vs Comments), and the expected output (post links vs comment links) are different, leading to different semantic meanings. Therefore, they do not return the same results.\"\n}"
