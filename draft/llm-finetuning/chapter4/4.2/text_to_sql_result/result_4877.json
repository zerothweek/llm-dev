"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically similar. The generated query is selecting specific columns ('Id' and 'Body') from the 'Posts' table with specific conditions (where 'Body' contains a newline and the 'PostTypeId' is 2). In contrast, the correct query selects all columns from 'sys.tables', which pertains to a system view listing all tables in the database. The contexts of the two queries (data retrieval from user posts vs. system metadata) are completely different.\"\n}"
