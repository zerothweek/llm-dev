"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical. The generated query seeks to find badges that John Skeet has but Jon Skeet does not have, based on specific criteria involving badge class. It performs multiple joins and subqueries to filter these results. In contrast, the '정답 쿼리' simply retrieves distinct badge names for a specific user ID (22656) without any comparison to another user. Therefore, the first query is dependent on relations and conditions related to both John Skeet and Jon Skeet, while the second query focuses only on a single user's badges, leading to different results.\"\n}"
