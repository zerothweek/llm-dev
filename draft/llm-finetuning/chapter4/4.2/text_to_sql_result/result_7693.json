"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically equivalent because they filter on different columns and values. The first query counts the entries where the 'notes' column is equal to 'honour division', while the second query counts the entries where the 'division' column is equal to 'division de honor'. These conditions target different attributes and potentially different subsets of data within the same table, which means they will likely yield different results.\"\n}"
