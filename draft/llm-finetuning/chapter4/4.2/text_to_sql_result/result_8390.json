"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries do not return semantically identical results due to several differences: 1) The first query filters posts based on a tag string using LIKE, while the second query uses a direct match on Tags.TagName with a variable, which is more precise. 2) The first query is for PostTypeId = 2 (which likely corresponds to answers), while the second query checks for PostTypeId = 1 (which likely corresponds to questions). 3) The first query uses CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() whereas the second uses GETDATE(), indicating a potential difference in the SQL dialect or time handling. 4) The first query returns additional user information (DisplayName) which the second query does not. Thus, the two queries are not semantically equivalent.\"\n}"
