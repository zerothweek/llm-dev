"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical. The first query returns the maximum value of 'Gross Domestic Product' for records where 'US Dollar Exchange' is '12.19 algerian dinar' and 'Inflation Index (2000=100)' is greater than 22. The second query, however, calculates the sum of 'Gross Domestic Product' under the same conditions. Therefore, they produce different types of results: one gives the maximum GDP value, while the other gives the total GDP value, which is a significant distinction.\"\n}"
