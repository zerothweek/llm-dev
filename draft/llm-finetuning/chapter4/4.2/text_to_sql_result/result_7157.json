"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically equivalent. The generated query uses the MAX function to find the maximum value of fastest_laps where poles and podiums are both 0 for the 1995 season. On the other hand, the answer query uses the SUM function, which calculates the total of fastest_laps for the same conditions. MAX and SUM provide different types of aggregate results, so they will yield different outputs.\"\n}"
