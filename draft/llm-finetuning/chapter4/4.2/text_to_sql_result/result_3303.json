"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The generated query calculates the average year of Diego Nargiso being the runner-up in the specified tournament, while the correct query retrieves the specific year(s) for which he was the runner-up. Thus, the first query may return a single average value or an empty result if there are no matches, whereas the second query will return distinct years. They do not return the same semantic meaning.\"\n}"
