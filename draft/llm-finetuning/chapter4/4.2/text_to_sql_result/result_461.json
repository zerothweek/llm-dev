"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries do not yield semantically the same result. The first query incorrectly checks for 'Kilometer' equating to 'berendrij', which is not relevant to the problem as it should be focused on finding asphalt course distances, where 'Average climb (%)' is less than 7% and 'Length (m)' is greater than 645m. The second query attempts to average 'Kilometer', which does not pertain to the distance of the courses but rather a different metric. Furthermore, the conditions between both queries differ; the first query filters by 'Length (m)' inaccurately, while the second correctly uses 'Length (m) > 645'. Therefore, the logic and focus of the queries diverge regarding the asked information.\"\n}"
