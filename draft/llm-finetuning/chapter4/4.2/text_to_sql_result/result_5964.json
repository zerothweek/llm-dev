"{\n    \"answer\": \"1\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Both SQL queries are semantically identical because they both retrieve the 'position' for the draft pick number 10. The use of single quotes ('10') vs double quotes ('\\\"10\\\"') does not affect the outcome, as most SQL systems recognize both as string literals. As such, both queries will return the same result set if 'draft_pick__number' is stored as a string.\"\n}"
