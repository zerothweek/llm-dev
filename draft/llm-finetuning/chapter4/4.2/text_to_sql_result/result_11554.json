"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query checks for flights departing from Washington to Boston specifically between 6:00 PM (1800) and 10:00 PM (2200) on August 27, 1991. In contrast, the second query is looking for flights that either depart between midnight (0) and noon (1200) on August 28 or not between midnight (0) and noon (1200) on August 27, while also excluding various times that fall between 6:01 AM (601) and 5:59 PM (1759). Thus, the first query is focused solely on a specific time range for the night of August 27, while the second query is broader, potentially including flights on August 28 and excluding different time ranges. Therefore, the two queries do not return the same results semantically.\"\n}"
