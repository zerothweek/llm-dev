"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically equivalent because they are selecting different columns and have different ordering. The generated query returns the 'Id' (as 'post_link') and 'Score' of posts, sorted by 'Score' in descending order, limited to 50 results. The correct query returns 'CreationDate', 'Body', and 'Id' (as 'post_link'), without any sorting or limiting of the results. This means the output structure and the results of the two queries can vary significantly.\"\n}"
