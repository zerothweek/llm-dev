"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first SQL query filters users located in Iran (with a specific check for lowercase and uppercase variations of the country name) and requires a minimum reputation of 5000, while the second query is more generic and filters users based on any country name (represented by ##CountryName##) with a lower minimum reputation requirement of 500. Thus, they are not semantically equivalent as they apply different country filters and reputation thresholds.\"\n}"
