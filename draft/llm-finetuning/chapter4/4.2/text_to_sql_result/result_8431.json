"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically identical. The first query counts posts of type 1 that contain a specific tag (Tag1) but exclude posts with tags Tag2 and Tag3. In contrast, the second query counts posts of type 1 that contain any of the tags '<vba>', '<excel>', or '<excel-vba>'. The conditions and tags considered in each query are different, leading to potentially different counts based on the content of the Tags field.\"\n}"
