"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query calculates the average number of interceptions ('INT') for players with an average under 8, a 'Long' of 0, and named 'mike douglas'. The second query counts the number of interceptions ('INT') for players meeting the same criteria but for 'mike douglass'. Therefore, the two queries return different types of results (average vs count) and the player names do not match, resulting in semantically different outcomes.\"\n}"
