"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical. The first query checks if there exists a course (615) that ends before 5 PM and another course (554) that ends after 5 PM in the EECS department, returning true if such a scenario exists. The second query checks if there are any courses (either 615 or 554) that end after 5 PM in the specific semester (WN 2016), returning true if no such courses exist. Therefore, they evaluate different conditions and produce different logical outcomes.\"\n}"
