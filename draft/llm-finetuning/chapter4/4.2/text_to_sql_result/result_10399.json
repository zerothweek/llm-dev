"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries sort the results differently: the first query sorts by 'season' in descending order while the second query sorts by 'id' in descending order. This means they may return different teams depending on how 'season' and 'id' are structured in the table. Therefore, they do not semantically return the same result for the task of finding the last team played for.\"\n}"
