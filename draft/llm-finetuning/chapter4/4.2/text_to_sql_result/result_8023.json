"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically equivalent because they are referring to different tables related to the courses. The first query counts the number of registrations for the English course from the 'student_course_registrations' table, while the second query counts the number of attendances for the English course from the 'student_course_attendance' table. Therefore, the results may differ as one counts registered students and the other counts students who actually attended the course.\"\n}"
