"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The generated query uses 'result = \\\"08-6\\\"', which does not match the format of the result in the problem statement. The correct query 'result = \\\"08 Fired in week 10 (2008-03-06)\\\"' specifies a complete and distinct result string that includes both the firing status and the date. Therefore, they do not return the same results semantically.\"\n}"
