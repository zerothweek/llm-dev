"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically identical. The first query retrieves distinct airline codes from the 'airline' table where the airline code is 'YN', while the second query fetches distinct fare basis codes from the 'fare_basis' table where the fare basis code is 'YN'. They operate on different tables and different attributes, so they return different results and therefore are not equivalent.\"\n}"
