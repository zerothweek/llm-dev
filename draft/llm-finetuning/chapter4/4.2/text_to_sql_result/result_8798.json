"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query filters users who have more than 400 answers and orders the results based on the average score per answer. The second query, however, only filters for users with more than 10 answers and has an additional condition that checks whether the answers are community-owned. Additionally, the first query includes more detailed statistics including upvotes and downvotes per answer, while the second does not. The LIMIT clause in the first query also limits the results to the top 100 users by average score, while the second query does not have a LIMIT clause.\" \n}"
