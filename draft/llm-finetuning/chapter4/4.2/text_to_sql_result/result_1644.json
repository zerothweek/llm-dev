"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries differ in the condition for the '% rank.' field. The generated query checks for '% rank.' equal to the string '47%', while the correct query checks for '% rank.' equal to the string '47'. This means the generated query is looking for a percentage formatted with a '%' sign, while the correct query is looking for the numerical value without the '%' sign. Therefore, they do not return the same results.\"\n}"
