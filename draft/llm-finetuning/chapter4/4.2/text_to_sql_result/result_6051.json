"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query calculates the ratio of votes by counting the number of upvotes (VoteTypeId = 2) and downvotes (VoteTypeId = 3) from the Votes table, providing a specific ratio for two types of votes. The second query, however, aggregates the total number of upvotes and downvotes per user from the Users table and joins with the Posts table, but it does not compute a ratio of these votes and does not focus only on VoteTypeId 2 and 3. Therefore, the two queries do not return the same semantic result.\"\n}"
