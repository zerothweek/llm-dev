"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries do not return semantically identical results. The first query retrieves posts from the 'Posts' table where 'ParentId' is NULL and 'PostTypeId' equals 5, along with their 'ViewCount', 'Tags', and 'ExcerptPostId' and 'WikiPostId', ordered by 'ViewCount'. The second query selects the tag names and constructs a 'wikilink' for each tag while joining the 'Posts' table with the 'Tags' table where the 'WikiPostId' matches the post id, and it limits the results to 10 entries ordered by 'ViewCount'. As a result, the first query focuses on retrieving posts of a specific type without tags while the second one focuses on tags associated with posts and limits the output to ten results, thus producing different outputs and intentions.\"\n}"
