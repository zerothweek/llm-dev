"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The generated query retrieves post IDs from the 'Posts' table where the post type is 2, the score is greater than 0, and the owner user ID matches a specific user ID. In contrast, the correct query selects the title, ID, score, and view count from the 'Posts' table where the post type is 1. The two queries operate on different post types and have different selection criteria, therefore they do not yield the same results semantically.\"\n}"
