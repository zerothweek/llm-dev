"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves the Score of all posts of type 2 that belong to a specified user. The second query, however, joins the Posts table with itself to get posts that are answers (parent posts) linked to their questions. It retrieves the Score along with the post ID and title based on this relationship, effectively returning a different set of data which includes additional information (post ID and title) and is structured to reflect relationships between parent and child posts. Therefore, they do not return the same results.\"\n}"
