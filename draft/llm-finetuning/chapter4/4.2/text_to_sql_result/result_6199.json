"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves the display name and reputation of users with a reputation greater than 10,000, along with their tags, but does not perform any aggregation or filtering based on the number of tags. The second query counts the number of tags associated with users who have a reputation greater than 10,000 and only returns those users who have more than 5000 tag associations. Thus, the two queries are semantically different, as one focuses on user information while the other focuses on counting tags and includes a condition on that count.\"\n}"
