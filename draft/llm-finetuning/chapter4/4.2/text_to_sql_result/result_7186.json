"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query retrieves paper IDs that have keyphrases either 'Convolutional' or 'Combinatorial' (including duplicates of those keyphrases). It filters papers based on the presence of either keyphrase. The second query looks for paper IDs that only have one unique keyphrase from the set ('Convolution' or 'Combinatoric') and uses HAVING to ensure that only those IDs are selected, meaning it expects papers that have exactly one of the specified keyphrases. Thus, the second query will exclude any papers that have both or those associated with neither keyphrase, leading to different results between the two queries.\"\n}"
