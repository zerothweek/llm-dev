"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The queries are not semantically equivalent. The generated query selects posts with a score less than 0 from a specific user, while the reference query specifically selects posts with a score exactly equal to 0 and requires that the owner's reputation be less than 50. This means that the generated query may return posts that the reference query will not, due to the different score conditions and the additional reputation condition in the reference query.\"\n}"
