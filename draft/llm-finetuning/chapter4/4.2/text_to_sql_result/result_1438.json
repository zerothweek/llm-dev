"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves the TagName and Body from Posts where the OwnerUserId is equal to a specific user ID, joining Posts with Tags based on the Post's ID being equal to the ExcerptPostId in the Tags table. The second query, on the other hand, retrieves TagName, Count, LastEditorUserId, LastEditDate, and Body from Tags based on a join with Posts using the WikiPostId. Additionally, it introduces conditions on the Body that look for specific textual patterns (using LIKE), along with an ordering by Count. Therefore, the two queries are semantically different, as they target different attributes and conditions in the data retrieval process.\"\n}"
