"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The queries do not return semantically identical results. The first query counts the number of distinct posts that have the tag 'django' per creation date, while the second query retrieves tags that start with 'django' and are not associated with a wiki post. The first query focuses on posts, their creation dates, and tags, while the second query is purely about the tags and their associated properties. Thus, they serve different purposes and yield different types of results.\"\n}"
