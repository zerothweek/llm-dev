"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The queries are not semantically equivalent. The first query retrieves badge information related to tags associated with a specific user, counting the number of badges grouped by several parameters. On the other hand, the second query counts the number of posts that have a specific title ('Site statistics') and has a parent-child relationship. They operate on different data and return fundamentally different types of information: one relates to badges and their association with users, while the other is focused on post statistics.\"\n}"
