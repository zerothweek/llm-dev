"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"Two queries are not semantically equal because they filter based on different admission types and long titles. The first query counts patients with 'TRANSFER FROM HOSP/EXTRAM' as their admission location and 'Lymphangioleiomyomatosis' as their long title, while the second query counts patients with 'ELECTIVE' as their admission type and 'Sarcoidosis' as their long title. Thus, the criteria for counting patients are different.\"\n}"
