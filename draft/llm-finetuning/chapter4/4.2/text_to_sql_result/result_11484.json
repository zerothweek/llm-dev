"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query counts the number of posts of a specific type (PostTypeId = 2) created by a specific user (OwnerUserId = @UserId) where the body of the post contains a specific substring ('<script>'). The second query counts posts from the same type and user, but it also requires that these posts have a parent post (indicated by the join on ParentId) which has tags containing either '<javascript>' or '<jquery>'. Therefore, the second query has an additional condition related to parent posts and tags, making the results potentially different from the first query.\"\n}"
