"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query calculates the length of stay in days for an admission that is still ongoing (where dischtime is NULL), using the current date as the end date. The second query, on the other hand, retrieves the length of stay for an admission that has been completed (where dischtime is NOT NULL) and orders by admission time to fetch the latest one. Therefore, they target different sets of admissions (ongoing vs completed) and will yield different results, which is why they are not semantically equivalent.\"\n}"
