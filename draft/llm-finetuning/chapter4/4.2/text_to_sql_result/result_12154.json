"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves TargetTagName from TagSynonyms based on the existence of posts with a specific SourceTagName and that lack the corresponding TargetTagName. It focuses on tagging semantics. The second query fetches a more detailed set of information from TagSynonyms and Tags, specifically targeting counts of tags and filtering based on tag approval, which adds an additional requirement not present in the first query. Therefore, the two queries aim at different aspects of tag synonym management, leading to semantically different outcomes.\"\n}"
