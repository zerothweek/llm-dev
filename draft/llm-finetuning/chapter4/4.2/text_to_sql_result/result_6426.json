"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two queries do not return the same results due to differences in the PostTypeId filter and additional conditions. The first query filters for PostTypeId = 2, while the second query filters for PostTypeId = 1. Additionally, the second query requires a Score of at least 25, a condition not present in the first query. Consequently, they may return different sets of posts based on these criteria.\"\n}"
