"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query selects records where left_ventricular_ejection_fraction_lvef is exactly 36 or exactly 50, while the second query selects records where left_ventricular_ejection_fraction_lvef is between 36 and 50 inclusive. Thus, the first query will only return records with lvef values of 36 or 50, whereas the second query will return records with lvef values in the entire range between 36 and 50, including values like 37, 38, etc. These differing criteria mean that the two queries do not return the same results semantically.\"\n}"
