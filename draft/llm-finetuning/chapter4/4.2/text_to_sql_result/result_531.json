"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query retrieves posts of type 1 containing links while excluding certain HTML tags and ensuring the posts have a positive score and a significant view count (more than 1000) but does not limit the length of the body. The second query retrieves posts of type 2 that are not closed and have other specific link domains, limits the body length to 500 characters, and checks for the presence of code tags. Therefore, the queries have different conditions regarding post type, view count, body length, and tag checks, leading to different semantic results.\"\n}"
