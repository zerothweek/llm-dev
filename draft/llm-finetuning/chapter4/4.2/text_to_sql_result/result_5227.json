"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The generated query checks for users with a specific condition related to their upvotes and downvotes, specifically targeting users who have more than 100 upvotes, zero downvotes, and a reputation less than 2000. It does not consider the average scores or standard deviations of posts associated with those users. Conversely, the correct query focuses on finding users with at least 10 posts, calculating the average score, standard deviation, and other aggregated metrics from their posts specifically with the tag 'firebase'. The criteria for finding suspicious voting behavior are different, thus making the two queries semantically different.\"\n}"
