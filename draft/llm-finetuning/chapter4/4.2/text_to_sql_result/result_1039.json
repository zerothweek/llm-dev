"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The first query correctly filters the customers to include only those who have at least 2 accounts, thanks to the HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 clause. The second query does not include any filtering for the number of accounts, meaning it will return all customers regardless of how many accounts they have. Therefore, the two queries do not yield the same results.\"\n}"
