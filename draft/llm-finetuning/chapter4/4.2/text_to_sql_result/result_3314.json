"{\n    \"answer\": \"0\",\n    \"explanation\": \"The two SQL queries are not semantically identical. The generated query selects the 'Id' and 'Tags' from the 'Posts' table for posts created in 2013 with 'PostTypeId' equal to 1, regardless of whether they are closed or not. In contrast, the correct query selects 'Id', 'OwnerUserId', 'CreationDate', and 'Score' from 'Posts' with 'PostTypeId' equal to 1, specifically excluding closed posts (i.e., 'ClosedDate IS NULL') and requiring creation dates from January 1, 2013, onward. Also, the correct query includes an ORDER BY clause for the 'Id', which is not present in the generated query.\" \n}"
